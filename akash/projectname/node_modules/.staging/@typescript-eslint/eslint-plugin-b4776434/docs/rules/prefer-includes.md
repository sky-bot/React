# Enforce `includes` method over `indexOf` method (@typescript-eslint/prefer-includes)

Until ES5, we were using `String#indexOf` method to check whether a string contains an arbitrary substring or not.
Until ES2015, we were using `Array#indexOf` method to check whether an array contains an arbitrary value or not.

ES2015 has added `String#includes` and ES2016 has added `Array#includes`.
It makes code more understandable if we use those `includes` methods for the purpose.

## Rule Details

This rule is aimed at suggesting `includes` method if `indexOf` method was used to check whether an object contains an arbitrary value or not.

If the receiver object of the `indexOf` method call has `includes` method and the two methods have the same parameters, this rule does suggestion.
There are such types: `String`, `Array`, `ReadonlyArray`, and typed arrays.

Additionally, this rule reports the tests of simple regular expressions
